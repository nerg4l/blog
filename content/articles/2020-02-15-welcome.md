summary: Let's talk about why I started this blog and how is it built.
---
This blog was created because I want to document my experience as a developer, create descriptions about the tools I use and how I use them, provide details about technologies, and lastly to see my progress over time through the articles of this blog. 

The blog is generated with [HUGO][hugo] which is a static site generator tool. I first read about it when [bootstrap][bootsrap] decided to switch from [Jekyll][jekyll]. [Switch to Hugo #24475][issue-24475] was open in October 2017. The mentioned ticket contains a lot of discussion about their needs and blocks. They finally opened a PR ([#28014][pr-28014]) in January 2019 which was merged in March 2019.

~~For the design [Material Components Web][material-components-web-github] and [bootstrap][bootsrap] is being used.~~ The first library as the name indicates provides web components for [Material Design][material-design]. As this is the official implementation I tend to use this in my projects. The second is beloved by me for its grid system and its utility classes. ~~For bundling these tools I decided to use [npm][npm] with [Laravel Mix][laravel-mix].~~ This way I was able to create a bundle very easily but also added a lot of dependencies. However, I will probably replace it with something else.

~~Originally I planed to host this site on [GitHub Pages][github-pages] but during reading [Hosting & Deployment][hugo-hosting-and-deployment] section of the HUGO documentation it turned out that [GitLab Pages][gitlab-pages] is easier to make the deployment automatic. I have to admit nowadays I started to prefer GitLab over GitHub.~~

## Update 2022-09-16

A lot has changed since I started this blog. I regretted my decision for using Material Components Web because they broke compatibility too many times, and let's be honest, this project does not need a fancy design. Laravel Mix was an other bad decision because it was not meant to be used outside the Laravel ecosystem. Whenever I tried to upgrade, I had some difficulties. Currently, I use [Vite][vite] instead as a bundler, but I already consider to not use any bundler. My preference for version control moved back to GitHub thanks to its new features and wider community. Finally, the blog is currently hosted on [Cloudflare Pages][cloudflare-pages] because it has an even simpler way of deployment with HUGO.
