summary: Let's talk about why I started this and how is it built.

This blog was created because I want to document my experience as a developer, create descriptions about the tools I use
and how I use them, provide details about technologies, and lastly to see my progress over time through the articles of
this blog. 

The blog is generated with [HUGO][hugo] which is a static site generator tool. I first read about it when
[bootstrap][bootsrap] decided to switch from [Jekyll][jekyll]. [Switch to Hugo #24475][issue-24475] was open
in October 2017. The mentioned ticket contains a lot of discussion about their needs and blocks. They finally opened a
PR ([#28014][pr-28014]) in January 2019 which was merged in March 2019.

For the design [Material Components Web][material-components-web-github] and [bootstrap][bootsrap] was used. The first
library as the name indicates provides web components for [Material Design][material-design]. As this is the
official implementation I tend to use this in my projects. The second is beloved by me for its grid system and its
utility classes. For bundling these tools I decided to use [npm][npm] with [Laravel Mix][laravel-mix]. This way I was
able to create a bundle very easily but also added a lot of dependencies. However, I will probably replace it with
something else.

Originally I planed to host this site on [GitHub Pages][github-pages] but during reading
[Hosting & Deployment][hugo-hosting-and-deployment] section of the HUGO documentation it turned out that
[GitLab Pages][gitlab-pages] is easier to make the deployment automatic. I have to admit nowadays I started to prefer
GitLab over GitHub.
