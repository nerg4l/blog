Recently I got interested in Matroska container and found out IETF is working on documents to make Matroska and EBML (the technology which defines the structure of Matroska files) a standard. These documents help developers to better understand the underlining technologies and to create implementations for them in any programming language.

While working on a Go implementation myself I've found some issues in the EBML specification and provided [an issue](https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/issues/395) and [a PR to fix it](https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/ebml-specification/pull/396). I can proudly announce my PR got merged.

I plan to keep working on my implementation and provide feedback if needed to help the IETF Cellar Group finalise EBML and Matroska specification.
