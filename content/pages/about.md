My real name is László GÖRÖG. I'm a full stack developer. I've got experience mainly with Java, JavaScript and PHP applications.

I spend my free time with programming. This gives me opportunities to explore and learn.

On the [projects page]({{< ref "projects/_index.md" >}}) you can read more about my long term ideas and ongoing projects.
